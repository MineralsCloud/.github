We are a research team at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/).
Our Principal Investigator is [Renata M. Wentzcovitch](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/renata-wentzcovitch).
Our research is devoted to computational quantum mechanical studies of materials at extreme conditions, especially planetary materials. We address electronic, structural, and vibrational properties from a fundamental and inter-related perspective.

Our current research interests include:
- Mineral physics with applications to geophysics (seismology and geodynamics) and geochemistry (water speciation and isotope fractionation in minerals)
- Materials discovery at (exo)planetary interior conditions
- H2O-ice physics
- Properties of strongly correlated oxides and their crystalline defects
- Spin crossover systems
- Simulations methods development
